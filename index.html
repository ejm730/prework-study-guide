        <ul>

          <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and styling of HTML documents.</li>
          <li>Selector is a css pattern that selects elemts of an HTML page to apply styles to. It can be an HTML tag, class, ID, or a combination of these.</li>
          <li>Declaration consists of a property and a value. It defines a specific aspect of an elemts style. For example 'color: blue;' is a declaration where 'color' is the property and 'blue' is the value.</li>
          <li>Property is an attribute of an element that you can modify to change its appearance or color. Examples include 'color', 'font-size', and 'background-color'.</li>
          <li>Value is assigned to a property and determines the soecific setting for that property. Example 'red', '12px', amd 'ffffff' are values that can be assigned to 'color', 'font-size', and 'background-color' respectively.</li>
          <li>Class is a way to group elements that share the same styling. You can definea class in CSS and apply it to multiple HTML elements to apply the same styles to all of them. </li>
          <li>ID is similar to a class but is intended to be unique withing the HTML document. You can use ID to style a specific element.</li>
          <li>Selector Specificity refers to the rules that determine which stylesare aplied when there are conflicting styles targeting the same element. It is based on the specificty value of selectors and helps determine which styles take precedence.</li>
          <li>Inheritance is a principle in CSS where styles applied to parent elements are inherited by their child elements unless explicitly overridden. This allows for cascading styles throughout the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Box model describes the structure of an element. It consists of the content area, padding, border, and ,margin. Understanding the box model is essential for layout and positioning.</li>
          <li>Pseudo-classes are keywords that can be added to selectors to style elements based on their state or position. examples include ':hover', ':active', and ':first-child'.</li>
          <li>Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or screen size. They enable responsive design by adapting the layout and appearance of the webpage.</li>
