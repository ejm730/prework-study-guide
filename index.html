        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          
          <li>HTML is the basic foundation for webpage structure</li>
          <li>The head element conatains information about the webpage such as metadata, which is not viewed by the user.</li>
          <li>The body element is the container for the content of an HTML document. It represents the main content visible to the user in the browser window.</li>
          <li>h1, h2, h3, etc. are elements representing headings of different levels, ranging from the most important to less important subheadings. They help structure content.</li>
          <li>The p element respresents a paragraph, used to group text and create blocks of content that are seperate from eachother.</li>
          <li>The a element is an anchor or hyperlink. Allows you to create clickable links that can take users to other web pages, docs, or specific sections within the same page.</li>
          <li>The img element is used to imbed an image within the document. Requires the src attribute to specify the image source and provides alternative text using the alt attribute.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, li elements are used to create unordered lists and ordered lists. li represents individual list items that are contained within ul or ol.</li>
          <li>The div element is a versatile container that helps organize and group other elements. It doesn'y have any semantic meaning of its own but provides a way to group related content or apply styles to a section of the page.</li>
          <li>The span element is similar to div, but it is an inline container used for smaller sections of content or applying styles to a specific part of a larger block.</li>
          <li>The form element is used to create interactive forms on a webpage. It encapsulates input fields, buttons, checkboxes, and other form controls, allowing users to input and submit data.</li>
          <li>The table, tr, td elements are used to create tabular data. Table defines the table structure, tr represents table rows, td defines indivdual cells within the table.</li>
          <li>The header, footer, nav, and section elements provide structural meaning to specific parts of the document. Header represents the introductory content, footer represents the footer, nav is used for navigation menus, section is used to define a grouping of related content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and styling of HTML documents.</li>
          <li>Selector is a css pattern that selects elements of an HTML page to apply styles to. It can be an HTML tag, class, ID, or a combination of these.</li>
          <li>Declaration consists of a property and a value. It defines a specific aspect of an elements style. For example 'color: blue;' is a declaration where 'color' is the property and 'blue' is the value.</li>
          <li>Property is an attribute of an element that you can modify to change its appearance or color. Examples include 'color', 'font-size', and 'background-color'.</li>
          <li>Value is assigned to a property and determines the specific setting for that property. Example 'red', '12px', and 'ffffff' are values that can be assigned to 'color', 'font-size', and 'background-color' respectively.</li>
          <li>Class is a way to group elements that share the same styling. You can define a class in CSS and apply it to multiple HTML elements to apply the same styles to all of them. </li>
          <li>ID is similar to a class but is intended to be unique within the HTML document. You can use ID to style a specific element.</li>
          <li>Selector Specificity refers to the rules that determine which styles are aplied when there are conflicting styles targeting the same element. It is based on the specificty value of selectors and helps determine which styles take precedence.</li>
          <li>Inheritance is a principle in CSS where styles applied to parent elements are inherited by their child elements unless explicitly overridden. This allows for cascading styles throughout the HTML document.</li>
          <li>Box model describes the structure of an element. It consists of the content area, padding, border, and ,margin. Understanding the box model is essential for layout and positioning.</li>
          <li>Pseudo-classes are keywords that can be added to selectors to style elements based on their state or position. Examples include ':hover', ':active', and ':first-child'.</li>
          <li>Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or screen size. They enable responsive design by adapting the layout and appearance of the webpage.</li>

        <h2>GIT</h2>
        
        <ul>

          <li>git init intitializes a new repository in the current directory. It creates a hidden git directory that tracks changes to your files.</li>
          <li>git clone repository creates a local copy of a remote repository. It downloads the entire repositorys history and files to your machine.</li>
          <li>git add -A adds a file or changes to the staging area. It prepares the changes to be included in the next commit.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "message" records the changes in the staging area to the git repository. It creates a new commit with a descriptive message explaining the changes.</li>
          <li>git status shows the current status of your git repository. Displays information about tracked an untracked files as well as the branch you're on.</li>
          <li>git log displays a history of commits in the repository. It shows the commit messages, authors, timestamps and unique commit identifiers ie. hashes.</li>
          <li>git pull updates your local branch with the latest changes from the remote repository. It fetches the changes and merges them with your local branch.</li>
          <li>git push uploads your local branch and commits to the remote repository. It updates the repository with your changes, making them available to others.</li>
          <li>git branch lists existing branches in your repository. It shows the current branch and highlights branches that exist.</li>
          <li>git checkout "branch" switches to a different branch. It allows you to work on a different branch, creating a new workspace for changes.</li>
          <li>git merge "branch" combines changes from one branch into another. It integrates the changes from the specified branch into the current branch.</li>
          <li>git remote lists the remote repositories linked to your local repository. It displays the names of remote repositories such as "origin".</li>
          <li>git fetch retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them onto your local branch. It updates your local references to the remote branches.</li>
          <li>git diff shows the differences between files or branches. It highlights changes in the code, indicating additions, deletions and modifications.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>JavaScript is a high level, interpreted programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is primarily used for client side scripting in web development.</li>
          <li>Variable is a named container that stores data. It represents a memory location where values can be stored and retrieved during the execution of a javascript program.</li>
          <li>Function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can accept inputs called parameters</li>
          <li>Conditional statements allow you to make decisons in your code based on certain conditions. The most common conditional statements in JavaScript are 'if', 'else if', and 'else'.</li>
          <li>Looping Statements enable you to repeat a block of code multiple times. JavaScript provides various looping constructs such as 'for', 'while', and 'do-while' loops.</li>
          <li>Event is an action or occurence, such as a button click or page load, that can trigger JavaScript code to execute. Event handling allows you to respond to these events and perform actions accordingly.</li>
          <li>DOM 'Document Object Model' represents the structure of an HTML document as a heirarchical tree of objects. Javascript can interact with the DOM, allowing you to access and manipulate elements, modify their properties, and respond to user interactions.</li>
          <li>Callback Function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later when a certain event or condition occurs. Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous operations and event handling.</li>
          <li>Error Handling: JavaScript provides mechanisms for handling errors and exceptions that occur during program execution. This allows you to catch and handle errors gracefully, preventing them from crashing your program.</li>
          <li>Scope defines the accessibility and visibilty of variables and functions within a JavaScript program. Understanding scope is crucial for managing variable lifetimes and avoiding naming conflicts.</li>
          <li>Comments are non-executable lines in your code that provide explanations or notes for yourself and other developers. They are ignored by JavaScript interpreter.</li>
          <li>Data types:</li>
          <li>Number - represents numeric values, such as integers and floating point numbers.</li>
          <li>String - represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.</li>
          <li>Boolean - represents either 'true' or 'false'.</li>
          <li>Array - represents an ordered collection of values.</li>
          <li>Object - represents a collective of key-value pairs.</li>
          <li>Null - represents the intentional abscence of any object value.</li>
          <li>Undefined - represents a declared variable that has not been assigned a value.</li>
