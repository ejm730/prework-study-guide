# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- The motivation for creating this webpage was to build the foundation of my web development skills, among other things i will further build upon and hope to use in my career one day.
- I built this project so that i could better understand the functions and framework of what goes into making a website. 
- Creating this wesbite helped me understand what is necessary when taking on a challenge such as this.
- In short, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript, including the basic terminology and functions of all listed. I also learned how github is a very important tool for creating any type of software or code. Understanding that most work in this environment will need some peer review as well as general understanding of how gitflow works also helped me alot in this process.
